<p>
This <a href="https://bayescomp2025.sg/">Bayes Comp 2025</a> Satellite Workshop is about methods, theory and applications for Bayesian inference with misspecified models.
</p>

<section>
  
<h4> Outline </h4>

<p>  
A common justification for the use of Bayesian inference is that Bayes’ theorem is the optimal way to update beliefs based on new observations, and that representing beliefs through a posterior distribution is desirable for uncertainty quantification. However, standard posterior distributions are only meaningful when the model or likelihood is well-specified, which is not the case in the presence of outliers, adversarial contaminations, or faulty measurement instruments. This realisation has led to an increased focus on generalisations of Bayesian inference which aim to produce ‘generalised posterior distributions’ that provide some representation of uncertainty but also overcome some of the lack of robustness of standard posteriors. The aim of this workshop will be to give a broad overview of this topic, touching on both foundational questions and algorithmic advances, and inviting the BayesComp community to take a more active role in solving some to the remaining open challenges in this area.
